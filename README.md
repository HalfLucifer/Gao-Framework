Gao-Framework
=============

Gao is a C++ based game framework which is primarily used for game app. 
The framework is meant to provide a generic class and can be implemented in different platforms.

Gao has also heavily integrated with Lua to cope with game logic and scripting. 
For the binding of Lua and C, I choose to use Luabind, and it depends Boost for its compilation.
